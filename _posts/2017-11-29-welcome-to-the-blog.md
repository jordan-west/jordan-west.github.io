Hello and welcome to my first post on this blog. This blog is going to document things that I learn as I work on different programming projects. With any luck, hopefully some of the things that I write about may be useful for other people.

I am running [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to statically generate the HTML pages, which makes maintaining and updating the blog a breeze. I am using a customized version of the [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme. You can see the code for the blog at the <i class="fa fa-github"></i> [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jordanlwest/jordanlwest.github.io).
