My name is **Jordan West** and I am a programmer who is interested in artificial intelligence and game development. I've been coding since I was 12 where I started with Lua, and have since then transitioned into C, C++ and C#. 

In this blog I hope to document things that I am learning about and come across as I work on various projects.
