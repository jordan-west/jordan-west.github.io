My name is **Jordan West** and I am a software engineer who has an interest in artificial intelligence and game development. I've been coding since I was 12 where I started with Lua, and have since then transitioned into C, C++ and C#. I enjoy exploring solutions that provide a deeper understanding of what's happening under the hood.
